Mi-

A. AND WHAT IS EVIL IN YOUR SIGHT I HAVE DONE.

Mi-
A. HAVE MERCY ON ME ...

C. So, Lord, you are justified in your sentence
A. AND BLAMELESS IN ALL YOUR JUDGEMENTS.
C. Behold I was brought forth in iniquity
A. AND IN SIN MY MOTHER CONCEIVED ME.

Mi-
A. HAVE MERCY ON ME ...

C. It is you, Lord, who desires truth in the inmost being:
A. THEREFORE TEACH ME WISDOM IN MY SECRET HEART.
C. Cleanse me with hyssop and I shall be clean,
A. WASH ME AND I SHALL BE WHITER THAN SNOW.

Mi-
A. HAVE MERCY ON ME ...

C. Fill me with joy and gladness,
A. LET THE BONES YOU HAVE CRUSHED REJOICE AGAIN.
C. Hide your face from my sin,
A. BLOT OUT ALL MY INIQUITIES.

Mi-
A. HAVE MERCY ON ME ...

C. Restore to me the joy of your salvation
A. AND UPHOLD ME WITH A WILLING SPIRIT;
C. then I will teach transgressors your ways
A. AND SINNERS WILL RETURN TO YOU.

Mi-
A. HAVE MERCY ON ME ...
