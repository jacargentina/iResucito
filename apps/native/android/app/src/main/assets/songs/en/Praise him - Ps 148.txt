C. Praise the Lord from the heavens

A:    Praise Him!
                         Am
C:    Praise Him in the heights

A:    Praise Him!

C:    Praise Him and all his angels,
praise Him all his hosts.

Praise Him sun and moon,
praise Him all you shining stars.

Praise Him you highest heavens,
and you waters above the heavens.

Let them praise the name of the lord,
for He commanded and they were created.

And he established them forever                        Kings of the earth and all the peoples.
He set a law that will never pass                      princes and rulers of the earth.

Praise the Lord from the earth        Young men and maidens together,
you sea monsters and all deeps        old men and children.

Fire and hail, snow and frost,                         Let them praise the name of the Lord,
stormy wind that follows His Word.                     for his name alone is exalted.

Mountains and every hill,             His glory is above earth and heaven,
Fruit trees and every cedar.          He has raised up His people.

Beasts wild and tame,                                  Let all His faithful praise the Lord,
reptiles and flying birds.                             Israel his chosen people.
