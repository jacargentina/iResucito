   Am                                                                           Dm
A. TO YOU, O LORD, WITH MY VOICE I CRY FOR HELP.
                                                                            Am
TO YOU, O LORD, IN MY PLEADING I ENTREAT YOU.
    E
TO YOU, I POUR OUT MY LAMENT,
    F                                                   E
TO YOU, MY ANGUISH I UNFOLD.

    Dm
C. I feel that my spirit faints,
                                  E7
but you know my path.
Am                                 Dm
Look, Lord, on the way,
                                                              Am
look, they have laid a snare for me.
E                                                                        E7
Look, at my right hand there is no one, 
      F                                    E
no one who knows me.
Dm
Every consolation flees from me,
                                                                             E7
for there is no one who cares for my soul.

   F                               G
A. TO YOU I CRY, O LORD.
                                                                               E7
TO YOU I SAY, "YOU ALONE ARE MAY REFUGE.
         F
YOU ARE MY LOT ON THIS EARTH,
                      E
MY ONLY HAPPINESS."
    Dm                               E
C. Listen, Lord, to my clamour
Dm                                        E
because I am so depressed.
F                                                           G
Free me from my enemies
                                                E
who are stronger than me.
F                                                                   G
Snatch my soul from this prison
                                                               E
and I will give thanks to your name.
     F
Then the saints will gather around me,
                                                                               E
they will rejoice for your love towards me.

A. TO YOU, O LORD, WITH MY VOICE...

C&A. TO YOU I CRY, O LORD...
