A. A CLEAR VOICE RESOUNDS FROM HEAVEN,
                                          Am
IT DIFFUSES IN THE NIGHT;
                                                            G
LET DREAMS AND ANGUISH FLEE,
                                                Am
THE LIGHT OF CHRIST SHINES.

C. The heart rises from slumber,
no longer troubled by evil;
a new star is gleaming
amidst the darkness of the world.

A. BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD,
PRICE OF OUR RANSOM.
WITH LIVING FAITH WE IMPLORE
HIS FORGIVENESS AND PEACE.

C. When in the end of time
Christ comes in glory,
may his grace free us
from his terrible judgment.

A. PRAISE BE TO CHRIST THE LORD,
TO THE FATHER AND TO THE SPIRIT,
AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING,
IS NOW AND FOREVER. 
G    Am
AMEN.
