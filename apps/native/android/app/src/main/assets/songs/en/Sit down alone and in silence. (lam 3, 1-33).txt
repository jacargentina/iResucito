C. God, God,
    F#m                      Bm
has driven me and forced me
D
to walk in darkness.
       F#m
He has built for me a yoke,
         Bm     D
and He has pressed, has pressed my head.
     F#m
He has bent his bow,
     Bm           D
making me the target for His arrows.
     F#m
Though I call and cry,
      Bm
He shuts out, He shuts out
    D
my prayers.
    Em
To see where He has brought me
  A
in my wandering life
     D
is wormwood and gall.
     F#
What will I do
  Bm
if hope fails within me,
   A                         G
the hope that comes from the Lord
F#   A/G/F#
that comes from the Lord!

     D                      F#m
A. Sit down alone and in silence
  Bm                  D
because God has laid it upon you.
   F#m
Put your mouth in the dust,
Bm              D
there may yet be hope.
     Em                           A7
Offer your cheek to him who strikes you;
 G
For the Lord               |
A    |
does not cast off forever  |
G                          | (x2)
even if He afflicts you    |
A        |
He will then be merciful.  |

A7                                D
C. According to the abundance of his love.
