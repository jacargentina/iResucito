Give ear to my plea:
       F                      E
my lips do not betray you O Lord;
        F                      E
from you let the sentence come,
         Dm                                   E
let your eyes see, let your eyes see righteousness.

C. God search my heart;
    Dm                     Am
search me at night O Lord
        Am                       E
test me with the crucible, test me with the crucible,
                  F                       E
because you know there is no malice in me,
         F                          E
my mouth does not speak as men do,
       Dm
because I have followed your Word,
                                  E
I've avoided the way of the violent one;
           F                        E
To your way I've held fast my steps
MDm                                      E
and I will not stumble, and I will not stumble.

    Dm                           Am
turn your ear, listen to my voice,
                                 E
show me the wonders of your love,
                 F                                    E
because you save the one who entrusts himself to you
                 F                             E
because you help the one who leans on your right hand
             Dm                 E
like the apple of your eye guard me,
            Dm                   E
in the shadow of your wings hide me,
    F                  E
look they want to kill me.

C. Look at them, they're closed in their pride,
          Dm                                      Am
they speak through the arrogance of their mouths;
         Am                   E
they come towards me, they come towards me!
     F           E
Help me, O Lord!

free me from the men of this world,
            Dm                             E
from the men whose worry is only this life
     F                          E
fill them with your goods, Lord
     F                                       E
let even their children be filled with them
     F                             E
let the overflow be for their babies
      Dm
because when I awake, because when I awake,
                                          E
I will be satisfied with your face O Lord!
