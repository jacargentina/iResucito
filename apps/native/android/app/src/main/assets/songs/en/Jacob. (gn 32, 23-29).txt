     Am
C. It was night

when Jacob arose,
    F
took his wives with him
                 E
and all his sons
                                   Am
and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.

After taking them

he sent them across the stream,
     F
and sent also with them
                E
all his possessions:
                        Am
and Jacob remained alone.
            G
And someone            |
Am         |  (ASS.RPT.)
fought with him.       |
            G
And someone
                               Am
fought with him until the dawn.

And seeing that he couldn't overcome Jacob,
       F
struck the hollow of his hip:
                              E
and Jacob's hip was dislocated
                      Am
as he fought with Him.
    G                      Am
Let me go for dawn is coming.
    G                      Am
A. Let me go for dawn is coming.
    G                      Am
C. Let me go for dawn is coming.
    C          D
I will not let you go
        F        E
unless you bless me.
     C          D
A. I will not let you go
        F        E
unless you bless me.
      E7      Am
C. Then God asked:

'What is your name? What is your name?'
      F
'Jacob', he replied,
                    E
'Jacob', he replied.
      E7                         Am
'You shall no more be called Jacob.

          G      Am
A. Israel, Israel,
      G                   Am
Israel shall be your name.
      G                               Am
Israel: you have discovered your weakness.
      G                        Am
Israel, you shall lean on God.
      G                  Am
Israel: strong with God,
      G                Am
Israel: you shall win.
      G                               Am
Israel: you have discovered your weakness.
      G                        Am
Israel, you shall lean on God.

        G     Am
C. Israel, Israel.
        G                  Am
Israel  shall be your name.
