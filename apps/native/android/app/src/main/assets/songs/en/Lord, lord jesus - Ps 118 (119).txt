C. Lord, Lord Jesus!
      Am
May my plea reach your presence
      F
may your song spring from my lips,
      G
may my tongue sing your Words,
         F       E
Jesus, my life!
      Am
May your hand be with me to help me
      F
I await salvation from you
       G
may my soul live to praise you
       F                   E
look at me for I am lost.
      Am                      G
A. Come in search of your servant
      F          E
come Lord Jesus!
      Am                        G
Come for without you I'm lost,
      F          E
come Lord Jesus!
