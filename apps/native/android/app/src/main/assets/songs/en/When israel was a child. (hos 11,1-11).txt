WHEN ISRAEL WAS A CHILD. (Hos 11,1-11)
...>    La-      Re-      La-
C. When Israel was a child, I loved him,
Re-        La-
I called him like a son out of Egypt.
Re-      La-
But the more I repeated my call,
Fa                      La-
The further he strayed from me.

La-        Do              Sol          La-
A. HE DID NOT SEE THAT ALL MY CARE WAS FOR HIM.  (x2)
Sol      La-      Sol
ISRA-EL! ISRA-EL! ISRA-EL!

La-       Re-           La-
C. I taught Ephraim how to take his first steps,
Re-            La-
I steered him straight, using reins of kindness;
Re-         La-
I was to him like someone
Fa                        La-
who lifts a baby close to his cheek.
La-        Do
A. HE DID NOT SEE ...

La-         Re-          La-
C. You will be forced to go back into Egypt,
Re-          La-
the Assyrian king will wipe out all your sons,
Fa                   La-
because my people refused to convert to me.
La-        Do
A. HE DID NOT SEE ...

La-    Re-           La-
C. O Ephraim, how could I give you up?
Re-          La-
My heart recoils at the thought of parting from you.
Re-    La-
I will not destroy you,
Fa            La-
for I am God, not man.
La-        Do
A. HE DID NOT SEE ...

La-    Re-          La-
C. I will roar, and my sons will come from Egypt,
Re-            La-
swiftly flying, like a bird.
Re-  La-
They will come speeding
Fa            La-
from Assyria like a dove.
La-        Do
A. HE DID NOT SEE ...
