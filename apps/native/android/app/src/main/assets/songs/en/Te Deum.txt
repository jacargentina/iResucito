C. Heaven and earth
are full of your glory.
The choir of apostles acclaims you
and the unstained throng of martyrs;

The voices of the prophets unite in your praise;
the holy Church proclaims your glory,
adoring your only Son,
and the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete.

O Christ, king of glory,
eternal Son of the Father,
you were born of the Virgin Mother
for the salvetion of man.



Victorious over death,
you opened to the faithful the kingdom 
of Heaven.
You sit at the right hand of God,
in the glory of the Father.
You will come to judge the world
at the end of time.

Help your children, O Lord,
you redeemed with your precious blood.
Receive us into your glory
in the assembly of saints.

Save your people, O Lord,
guide and protect your children.
Day by day we bless you,
we praise your name for ever.

Deign today, O Lord,
to keep us free from sin.
May your mercy be ever with us:
in you have we hoped.

Have mercy on us, O Lord,
have mercy on us.
You are our hope,
we shall not be shamed for ever.
