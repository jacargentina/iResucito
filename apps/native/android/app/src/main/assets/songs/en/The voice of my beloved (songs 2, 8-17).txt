C. The voice of my beloved:
     Am              F
behold here he comes
                    E
leaping on the mountains
     F               F
skipping on the hills.
    C
My beloved is like a gazelle
     Am           F
like a young deer,
                            E
my beloved is like a gazelle.
    C
Behold he stops
    Am          F
behind our wall

looks in at the window,
                        E
peers through the lattice.
    C
Now my beloved speaks and says to me:

    C(*)      E
A. Arise my beloved!      |
F                     |
Arise my love,         | (x2)
E          |
Arise and come.        |

     Dm                            E
C. Look, winter time has already passed
        Dm                              E
the rains are over, they have gone away.
         F
The flowers have appeared on the earth.
                                   E
the time for singing has come again,
            Dm(**)                          E
and the voice of the turtle-dove has returned,
     F
the fig-tree has blossomed with first fruits
                                      E
and the grape vine gives off its scent.(*)

    C(*)      E
A. Arise my beloved!...
          E                        Dm
O my dove in the cleft of the rock,
     Dm                            E
in the hiding places of the cliffs,
     F
let me hear your voice, let me hear your voice.
    C
Send the foxes away, the small foxes,
    F               E
who spoil the vineyard
    G        F              E
for our vineyard is in blossom,
    G        F              E
for our vineyard is in blossom.

    Dm                E       Dm        E
C. My beloved is for me, and I am for him
      Dm                E
before the breeze blows
              Dm                      E
and the shadows of death stretch forth.

      Am       G      Am
A. Return, Return, Return
