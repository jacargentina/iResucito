  Dm                    A7
C.       To You I lift up my eyes            All Repeat
          Gm                  A7
To You Who dwell in heaven            All Repeat

          Dm
C.       Like the eyes of slaves
                                   A7
Are fixed on the hand of their master,
  Gm                                                      A7
Like the eyes of a slave girl, on the hand of her mistress,
          Bb                     A      Gm
So our eyes are on the Lord.  For Him to take pity on us

          Dm               A
W.  Have pity on us, Lord
          Bb             A
M.    Have pity on us, Lord
          Dm                    A
W.      We are filled with contempt
          Bb                       A
M.      All to full is our soul with scorn
  Dm                     A
W.  With the disdain from the proud
          Bb                     A
M.      With the scorn from the complacent

          Dm             A
A.      Have pity on us, Lord
          Bb             A
All      Have pity on us, Lord
