# macOS filenames

In macOS the filenames (in songs/[locale]) are encoded in UTF "decomposed form"
When reading the filenames with react-native-fs sometimes filenames "look the same", but when
comparing equality fails. Its all about the UTF composed vs decomposed form.

Reference:

To convert any filename to be always "composed form":

  iconv -f utf-8-mac -t utf-8

songs/index.json should be always on "composed form"!!

When reading with react-native-fs the filenames should be "normalized".

Reference:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/String/normalize

  name.normalize();
