# macOS filenames and "File not found" error
 
For example, running the android simulator, you get:

  No such file or directory, open 'songs/es/Como oveja que ve como se llevan su corderito al matadero - Himno de San Romano el MÃ©lodo.txt'

In macOS the filenames (in songs/[locale]) are encoded in UTF "decomposed form"
When reading the filenames with react-native-fs sometimes filenames "look the same", but when
comparing equality fails. Its all about the UTF composed vs decomposed form. In this example, the accent e letter.

Reference:
- https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/83935/unicode-normalization-for-filenames-and-copied-text-from-pdfs

To convert any filename to be always "composed form":

  iconv -f utf-8-mac -t utf-8 [file path]

songs/index.json should be always on "composed form"!!
  
  iconv -f utf-8-mac -t utf-8 packages/core/assets/songs.json > packages/core/assets/songs-converted.json
  cp packages/core/assets/songs-converted.json packages/core/assets/songs.json
  rm packages/core/assets/songs-converted.json

When reading with react-native-fs the filenames should be "normalized".

Reference:
- https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/JavaScript/Referencia/Objetos_globales/String/normalize

  name.normalize();
