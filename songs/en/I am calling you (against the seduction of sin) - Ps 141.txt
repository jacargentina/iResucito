I AM CALLING YOU (AGAINST THE SEDUCTION OF SIN)PSALM 141

        Em                           B7
A:      I am calling you, I am calling you, O Lord            A:      I am calling you, I am calling you, O Lord.......
Am              B7                                        D      G                   B7
come , hurry to me                              C:      To you, O Lord, I turn my eyes,
    Em                            D         C
Listen to my voice for I cry to you,                        in you I take refuge, do not leave alone my soul
Em                  B7                           Am
let my prayer rise like incense,                              keep me from the snares they have laid for me
Am                  B7
and the lifting up of my hands like the evening sacrifice.      from the traps of my enemies.
D          G            B7                           G            Em                   B7
C:      Set O Lord, a sentinel at my mouth,                        Let them fall each into his own net
D         C             B7                              C                    B7
a guard at the door of my lips,                           for I, united to you,  pass unharmed
Am                   B7                        Am                    B7
lest my heart turn towards sin                           for I, united to you,  pass unharmed
Am               B7                                    
and commit wicked actions.                         A:      I am calling you, I am calling you, O Lord.......
G             Em           B7              Em
Let the just man strike me out of love and correct me
C                           B7
lest the oil of the wicked man anoint my head:
Am                  B7
for I would fall into his sins,
C                  B7
for I would fall into his sins.
