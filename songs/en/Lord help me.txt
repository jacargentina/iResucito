The gift of your grace
Am           F        E
has left my heart in blossom
 Em             E
with a thousand longings of love		(2)

I can do no more

than suffer
     F                E
and spend my life in sighs.
 C                                    G
And in this flame of your love, this dark flame,
    					       C
in this veil that enwraps my soul and stifles it,
 F                   E
I feel my heart dislocated
 F                E
opening, pouring out,
 F                                E
like water flooding through your garden.
