HOW MUCH LONGER. Psalm 12 (13)

    Am
C. How much longer
                              E
    will you forget me, O my Lord?
              E7                                 Am
    How much longer will you hide your face from me?


            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh,
             E                    Am
    I will sing to Him who is my Saviour.

     Am
C. Look at me,
                            E
    answer me Yahweh, O my love;

    give light to my eyes
                            Am
    lest I fall asleep in death.


            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh ...


     Am
C. Lest my foes say:
                            E
    I have prevailed over him,

    lest my oppressors rejoice
             Am
    because I've stumbled.


            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh ...

     Am
C. But I,
                      E
    I rely upon your love

    and my heart shall rejoice
                Am
    in your salvation.


            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh ...
