 B7                    E

   Pray for those who ill-treat you

                    A   E

   To him who slapped you on one cheek

 B7             E

   offer the other one as well

               A  E

   To him who takes away your cloak

 B7                E

   Do not refuse your tunic

   Give to every one who asks you

    C#

   and from him who takes

   your goods do not ask

    F#

   for their return

   Do not judge

   Do not condemn

   Woe to you that now are full

    A                  D

   for you shall go hungry

 A              D

   for you shall mourn and weep

   Bm                   A              G

   Woe to you when all men speak well of you

                     F#

   so they spoke to the false prophets

   Forgive

   and you will be forgiven

   Love your enemies

   Do good to those of you who hate you

   Do not judge......
