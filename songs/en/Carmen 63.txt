A-       E       F

Broken are my bonds

Dm           E

Paid are my debts

  F

My doors wide open

  E

I go everywhere

Dm                       E

They crouched in their corners,

    Dm

continue to weave the pale web of their hours

F	    		

or go back to sit in the dust

      E

to count their coins.

  F                E  	    		

And they call me, and they call me

F              E

to make me go back.

Am                           Em

But already my sword is forged

Am                        E7

Already I've put on my armour

G                   B

My horse is ready to run

D      A                F#

And I shall gain my kingdom

 B-               F#

And I shall gain my kingdom

D                  A

I shall gain my kingdom

D                  A

I shall gain my kingdom

E            A

I'll go everywhere
