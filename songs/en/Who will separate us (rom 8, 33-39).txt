C. Who will separate us,                        hunger, nakedness
        G
      who will separate us,                        if all these things we conquer
                F          E                                        E
      from the love of God?                        in Him who loved us?
        Am
A. Who will separate us,                  A. Who will separate...
      Am                                                        Am
      who will separate us,                  C. If we are sure
                F        E
      from the love of God?                        that neither death, nor life
                     Am
C. Could Jesus Christ,                          nor the present, nor the future
                                                                               G
      He who died                                  nor the height, nor the depth,
                    G                                                F
      He who rose again,                           nor any other creature
                                             F                        E
      He who sits at the right hand of the Father  can separate us from God                              C. If with
Him we die,
                      E                                    Am
      interceding for us?                    A. Can separate us
                                                                G
A. Who will separate...                         can separate us
            Am                                                   F
C. Tribulation,                                 from the love of God
    	            G                                                     E
      worry, persecution                           shown to us in Jesus Christ?

                                             A. Who will separate us...
