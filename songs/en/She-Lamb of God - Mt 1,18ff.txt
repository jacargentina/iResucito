herself pregnant by the work of the Holy Spirit.
Em                                                 
And Joseph who was just,

did not want to repudiate her.
        C                                                             B7

and does not want to be consoled

because they are no more.

How bitter are the waters, Mary!

A. SHE-LAMB OF GOD ...
Em
C. And the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph 
in Egypt and told him:
    Am
"Get up and take with you the child 
and his mother
    C
and go back to the land of Israel;
                                                                         Em
because from Egypt I have called my son."
