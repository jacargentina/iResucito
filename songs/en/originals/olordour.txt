***** O LORD, OUR GOD. Psalm 8 *****
****   ****
         Em                  G
C&amp;A.  O Lord our God how great is your name
           B7
      Throughout the earth, is your name;
          Am                          B7
      above the heavens rises your love!


        Am                             B7
C.    From the mouth of babes and infants
           Am                     B7
      You affirm your glory O Lord,
          C                             B7
      to reduce to silence enemies and rebels.


         Em
C&amp;A.  O Lord ...


         Am                                         B7
C.    If I look at the heavens, the work of your hands,
        Am                                          B7
      the moon and the stars that you have set in place,
         C                           B7
      what is man that you care for him?
         C                                  B7
      The son of man that you keep him in mind?
       G       B7                                         G
      Yet, yet you have made him little less than the angels
                                              B7
      with glory and honour you have crowned him.
         C                                 B7
      everything you have put under his feet.

         Em
C&amp;A.  O Lord ...
