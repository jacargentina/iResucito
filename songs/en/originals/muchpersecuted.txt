      Dm
A.  Much have they persecuted me
                A7
    since my youth,

    much have they persecuted me
                Dm
    let Israel say.
    Dm
    Much have they persecuted me
                A7
    since my youth,

    much have they persecuted me
                      Dm
    but have not prevailed.

C.  Upon my back, the ploughers ploughed,
    				  Dm
    Upon my back, they drew long furrows
    				A7
    Upon my back, the ploughers ploughed
    				  D
    Upon my back, they drew long furrows
    			   A7
    But the Lord, who is just,
             			D
    Has broken the yoke of the wicked,

A.  Let them fall back,
      			A7
    all those who hate Zion.

C.  Let them be like the grass growing on the roofs,
    				  	  Dm
    which dries up before it is plucked.
    				A7
    Never the reaper fills his hand with it,
    				       Dm
    nor the gatherer of sheaves fills his lap.


    Dm
A.  Let them fall back,
    	       		A7
    All those who hate Zion.

    Let them fall back,
    			D
    All those who hate Zion.
