****   ****
     E                                          F#m                   B7
C.   As the deer yearns                   A.    Hope in God, hope in God:
                              E
     for running streams                        and you'll praise Him again.
           C#m    C#7           F#m
     so my soul is yearning               C.    Because He, He is my salvation:
     F#m                            B7       C#m    A       G#
     for you my God.                            He is my God, He is my God.
               A            G#
     My soul is thirsting for God,        A.    Hope in God, hope in God
               A              B
     the living God                             hope in God, hope in God,
    B/Bb/A                       G#
     when shall I come                          and you will praise Him again.
  E                      E
     and see the face of God?             C.    How many times I say: 'My rock,

     Tears are my bread day and night,          why have you forsaken me?'

     while my enemies                           why do I walk so sadly
                        F#m
     say to me all day long:                    oppressed by my enemy?
    F#m                                  B7
     'Where is your God?                        My bones are crushed

     where is your God?                         by listening all day long:

     where is your God?'                        'Where is your God?
 B7                                          E
     And this I remember                        where is your God?'

     and my soul is filled with sadness         Lord, send your light and your truth
                                         F#m
     how I used to walk                         let them lead me to your holy mountain
   E   G#                 B7
     in the midst of rejoicing                  then I will be able to sing to you

     Why are you cast down my soul?             a song of joy, a song of happiness
 C#m                         E   G#
     why are you sighing within me?             with my guitar.

      Why are you cast down my soul ...
