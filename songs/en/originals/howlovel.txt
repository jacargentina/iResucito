***** HOW LOVELY ARE YOUR DWELLING PLACES. Psalm 83 (84) *****
****   ****
   C                              Em        Am
C.  How lovely are your dwelling places, O Lord,
    C       Em
    Lord of Hosts!
      F               C                            G
    My soul longs and yearns for the courts of the Lord.
   C                 Em      Am
    Even the sparrow finds a home,
        C           Em
    the swallow its nest
   F                   C
    near your altars O Lord
                   G
    my king and my God,
                   C
A.  my king and my God.
   F                               C
    Happy is he who lives in your house
                       G
    ever singing your praise,
                       C
    ever singing your praise.
                                      C
    Happy is he who finds in you the strength
                          G
    and decides in his heart
             C
    the holy journey.
   C                     Em       Am
    Passing through the valley of weeping,
       C                  Em
    He turns it into a spring
       F                         C
    his strength grows along the way
                      G
    til he arrives in Zion,
                      C
    til he arrives in Zion.

      F                   C
C.  For me a day in your courts
                                       C
    is worth more than a thousand elsewhere
      F
    to dwell at the gate of your house
                     G
    is better than to live
                          C
    in the palaces of the mighty.


     C                     Em       Am
A.  Passing through the valley of weeping ...

      F                   C
C.  For me a day in your courts ...
