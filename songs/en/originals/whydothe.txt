****   ****
   Em                      Am
C.  Why do the nations conspire?                |
                                   Em           |
    Why in vain are peoples plotting?           |
                                   Am           |
    They arise, the kings of the earth,         | (Ass.Rpt.)
                                    B7          |
    and the princes are plotting together       |
                                        Em      |
    against the Lord and against His Messiah.   |



C.  'Let us break their fetters asunder,
               	         Am
    let us cast their cords away.'
                                       B7
    He laughs at them who sits in the Heavens,

    from on high the Lord derides them

    to them He speaks with wrath,
                          Em
    He scares them in his anger.


    Am                         Em
A.  I have constituted Him my king                      |
        B7                                      Em      | (x2)
    on Zion my holy mountain, on Zion my holy mountain. |


    Em                                 Am
C.  I will announce the decree of the Lord,
              B7
    He said to me, 'You are my Son
                   Em
    today I have begotten you.
                                              Am
    Ask me, I will give you as possesion the peoples,
                                B7
    as domains the ends of the earth,

    you shall break them with rod of iron,
                               Em
    as clay vessels you will crush them.'


    Am                         Em
A.  I have constituted Him my king ...

    Am                B7
C.  And now kings be wise
    Am                         B7
    learn wisdom, judges of the earth;

    serve God with fear,
                         Em
    and with trembling exult.
                                       Am
    Lest He be angry and you lose the way
                                   B7
    for all of a sudden his wrath flares up
                                       Em
    blessed is he who takes refuge in Him.


    Am                         Em
A.  I have constituted Him my king ...
