A:    Praise the Lord Jerusalem........
							
C:    The Lord builds up Jerusalem
      and brings back Israel's exiles.
      The Lord raises the lowly,
      He humbles the wicked to the dust.
							
A:    Praise the Lord Jerusalem.......
							
C:    He covers the heaven with clouds,
      He prepares the rain for the earth,
      making mountains sprout with grass
      and with plants to serve man's needs.
							
A:    Praise the Lord Jerusalem.......
							
C:    His delight is not in horses
      nor his pleasure in warrior's strength.
      The Lord delights in those who revere him,
      in those who wait for his love.
							
A:    Praise the Lord Jerusalem.
