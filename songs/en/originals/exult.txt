****   ****

A.  Exult, you just in the Lord
    C                          G
    praise is fitting for the saint,
    G                   Em
    praise the Lord with the zither,
    C
    with the ten stringed harp,
            G
    sing to Him.


    Am                       B7
C.  Sing a new song to the Lord,
    Am                                 B7
    play the zither with art and acclaim him:
    C
    for the Word of the Lord is right
    D                   B7
    truth are all his works.
    C
    In him are justice and right,
             D               B7
    of his love the earth is full.


    G                       Em
A.  Exult, you just in the Lord
    C                          G
    praise is fitting for the saint,
    G                         Em
    praise the Lord with the zither,
    C
    with the ten stringed harp,
             G
    sing to Him.


    Am                               B7
C.  The Word of the Lord made the heavens,
           A7                       B7
    the breath of his mouth all his hosts.
    C
    The Lord brings to nothing

    the designs of the nations,
    D                               B7
    and defeats the plans of the peoples,
    C
    but the plan of the Lord,
    D                                B7
    the plan of the Lord stands for ever.


    G                       Em
A.  Exult, you just in the Lord
    C                          G
    praise is fitting for the saint,
    G                         Em
    praise the Lord with the zither,
    C
    with the ten stringed harp,
             G
    sing to Him.
