    Am         F
A.  When I awake,
                                       Am
    I'll be satisfied with your face| O Lord,
             Dm
    when I awake
                                 Am
    I'll be satisfied with your face| O Lord.


        Dm              Am
C.  Listen Lord to my prayer;
              Dm                   Am
    and be attentive Lord|to my clamour.
                    E
    Give ear to my plea:
       F                      E
    my lips do not betray you O Lord;
        F                      E
    from you let the sentence come,
         Dm                                   E
    let your eyes see, let your eyes see righteousness.


    Am         F
A.  When I awake ...


    Dm                Am
C.  God search my heart;
    Dm                     Am
    search me at night O Lord
        Am                       E
    test me with the crucible, test me with the crucible,
                  F                       E
    because you know there is no malice in me,
         F                          E
    my mouth does not speak as men do,
       Dm
    because I have followed your Word,
                                  E
    I've avoided the way of the violent one;
           F                        E
    To your way I've held fast my steps
    MDm                                      E
    and I will not stumble, and I will not stumble.


    Am         F
A.  When I awake ...


    Dm                  A
C.  To you I cry, Lord, answer me,
    Dm                           Am
    turn your ear, listen to my voice,
                                 E
    show me the wonders of your love,
                 F                                    E
    because you save the one who entrusts himself to you
                 F                             E
    because you help the one who leans on your right hand
             Dm                 E
    like the apple of your eye guard me,
            Dm                   E
    in the shadow of your wings hide me,
    F                  E
    look they want to kill me.


    Am         F
A.  When I awake ...


    Dm                                     Am
C.  Look at them, they're closed in their pride,
          Dm                                      Am
    they speak through the arrogance of their mouths;
         Am                   E
    they come towards me, they come towards me!
     F           E
    Help me, O Lord!
     F                            E
    free me from the men of this world,
            Dm                             E
    from the men whose worry is only this life
     F                          E
    fill them with your goods, Lord
     F                                       E
    let even their children be filled with them
     F                             E
    let the overflow be for their babies
      Dm
    because when I awake, because when I awake,
                                          E
    I will be satisfied with your face O Lord!


    Am         F
A.  When I awake ...
