 
***** JACOB. (Gn 32, 23-29) *****
****   ****
     Am
C.  It was night

    when Jacob arose,
    F
    took his wives with him
                 E
    and all his sons
                                   Am
    and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.

    After taking them

    he sent them across the stream,
     F
    and sent also with them
                E
    all his possessions:
                        Am
    and Jacob remained alone.
            G
    And someone            |
                Am         |  (ASS.RPT.)
    fought with him.       |
            G
    And someone
                               Am
    fought with him until the dawn.

    And seeing that he couldn't overcome Jacob,
       F
    struck the hollow of his hip:
                              E
    and Jacob's hip was dislocated
                      Am
    as he fought with Him.
    G                      Am
    Let me go for dawn is coming.
    G                      Am
A.  Let me go for dawn is coming.
    G                      Am
C.  Let me go for dawn is coming.
    C          D
    I will not let you go
        F        E
    unless you bless me.
     C          D
A.  I will not let you go
        F        E
    unless you bless me.
      E7      Am
C.  Then God asked:

    'What is your name? What is your name?'
      F
    'Jacob', he replied,
                    E
    'Jacob', he replied.
      E7                         Am
    'You shall no more be called Jacob.


          G      Am
A.  Israel, Israel,
      G                   Am
    Israel shall be your name.
      G                               Am
    Israel: you have discovered your weakness.
      G                        Am
    Israel, you shall lean on God.
      G                  Am
    Israel: strong with God,
      G                Am
    Israel: you shall win.
      G                               Am
    Israel: you have discovered your weakness.
      G                        Am
    Israel, you shall lean on God.


        G     Am
C.  Israel, Israel.
        G                  Am
    Israel  shall be your name.
