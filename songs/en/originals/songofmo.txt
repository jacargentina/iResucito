C.  Let us sing to the Lord,
                       A7
    let us sing to the Lord.
                            D7
    who covered himself in glory,

    in glory, in glory.
                           G7
    He has thrown into the sea

    horse and rider.

A.  My strength and my song
            A7
    is the Lord.
                 D7
    He is my salvation,

    is my God,
                 G7
    I will extol him.
                           C7
    He has thrown into the sea

    horse and rider. (2)

C.  The Lord is a warrior,
                   A7
    Yahweh is his Name
                    D7
    Pharaoh's chariots

    and the enemy's army
                         G7
    He has cast into the sea.

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C.  Your right hand, O Lord,
    glorious in power,
    your right hand, O Lord,
    shattered the enemy,
    shattered the enemy.

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C.  The enemy said:
    'I shall pursue and overtake,
    I shall draw my sword,
    my hand will get possesion
    my hand will despoil them.'

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C.  You blew with your breath
    the sea covered them.
    They sank like lead
    in deep waters,
    in the waters of death.

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C.  Who is like you, among the gods
    who is like you, O Lord,
    magnificent in holiness,
    terrible in deeds,
    worker of wonders?

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C.  You led this people
    that you have redeemed,
    in your strength you guided them,
    in your strength and love,
    to your holy dwelling.

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C.  You brought them in and planted them
    on the mountain of your promise,
    where O Lord you reign,
    you reign for all eternity
    you reign for ever and ever.

A.  He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...
