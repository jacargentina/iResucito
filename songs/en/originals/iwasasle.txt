****   ****
   C
C.  While I was asleep,
E
    but my heart was awake,
      Am
    the voice of my beloved I heard:
    Dm              E
    'Open to me, my sister,
    Dm              E
    open to me, my dove,

    for my head is wet with dew,
            Am
    my locks with the drops of the night.'
   C
    He puts his hand
     E
    through the latch of the door,
    La-
    my bowels stirred within me.
   Dm       E
    I arose running.

    and my hand dripped with myrrh,

    the purest myrrh from my fingers
Am
    on the bolt of the door.


    Am                           G
A.  I implore you daughters of Jerusalem,   |
    F                     |
    if you find my beloved                  | (x2)
  E                 |
    tell him I'm dying of love.             |


   C
C.  I opened to my beloved
    E
    He was not there
Am
    He had already gone.
    Dm                     E
    My soul fainted at his flight;

    I sought him, but I did not find him

    I called him, I called him
Am
    but he did not answer me.

    The watchmen met me,
    G
    going the rounds of the city,
     F
    they undressed me,
               E
    they beat me, the watchmen of the walls.


    Am
A.  I implore you ...


   Am                    G
C.  Ay! if you were my brother
F
    I could kiss you
     E
    without anyone being scandalised.
