****   ****
                         Am                                G
                    A.    He rose from death, he rose from death,
                                       F         E
                          he rose from death, alleluia!
                              Am        G          F
                          Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia,
                                        E
                          he rose from death!
      Am                                             Am
C.    Death                                  C.    Thanks
                 G                                                 G
      Where is death?                              be given to the Father
                   F                                                      F
      Where is my death,                           who brings us to his kingdom
                   E                                                         E
      Where is its victory?                        where we live through his love.


A.    He rose...                             A.    He rose...

       Am                                                         Am
C.    Rejoice,                               C.    If with Him we die,
                      G                                        G
      oh brothers, rejoice                         with Him we live:
                            F
      for if today we love each other,             with Him we sing:
                                  E                      E
      it is because he rose from death.            Alleluia!
    	

A.    He rose...                             A.    He rose...
