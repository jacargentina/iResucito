    D
C.  God, God,
    F#m                      Bm
    has driven me and forced me
D
    to walk in darkness.
       F#m
    He has built for me a yoke,
         Bm     D
    and He has pressed, has pressed my head.
     F#m
    He has bent his bow,
     Bm           D
    making me the target for His arrows.
     F#m
    Though I call and cry,
      Bm
    He shuts out, He shuts out
    D
    my prayers.
    Em
    To see where He has brought me
  A
    in my wandering life
     D
    is wormwood and gall.
     F#
    What will I do
  Bm
    if hope fails within me,
   A                         G
    the hope that comes from the Lord
F#   A/G/F#
    that comes from the Lord!


     D                      F#m
A.  Sit down alone and in silence
  Bm                  D
    because God has laid it upon you.
   F#m
    Put your mouth in the dust,
Bm              D
    there may yet be hope.
     Em                           A7
    Offer your cheek to him who strikes you;
 G
    For the Lord               |
  A    |
    does not cast off forever  |
    G                          | (x2)
    even if He afflicts you    |
    A        |
    He will then be merciful.  |


A7                                D
C.  According to the abundance of his love.
