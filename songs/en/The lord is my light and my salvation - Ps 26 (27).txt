THE LORD IS MY LIGHT AND MY SALVATION. Psalm 26 (27)

    Am             D               Am
C. The Lord is my light and my salvation:
    F    G      Am
    whom need I fear?
   D             Am
    The Lord is the fortress of my life:
F            G       Am
    of whom should I be afraid?

A. I am sure I shall see your goodness O Lord.
    E
    Wait for the Lord, take courage
    Am
    wait for the Lord, take courage
    E
    wait for the Lord, take courage
    Am
    wait for the Lord.

C. One thing I ask of the Lord,
    one thing I only seek:
    to live in the house of Yahweh
    all the days of my life.

A. I am sure I shall see ...

C. For He hides me under His shelter
    in times of trouble.
    He hides me deep in his tent
    sets me safe on a rock.

A. I am sure I shall see ...
