SONG OF BALAAM.(HOW BEAUTIFUL ARE YOUR TENTS) (Nm 23, 7-24)

     Em                      D
C. From Aram Balak made me come,

    the King of Moab,
                           Em
    from the Eastern Mountains:
     D                     Em
    'Come, curse Jacob for me,
     D                       Em
    come, prophesy against Israel'.
     G            D     G Bm            Em
    How shall I curse if God does not let me?
     G            D         G Bm          Em
    How shall I prophesy if God does not want?
              D                     Em
    From the top of this crag I see him,
              D                     Em
    from the top of this peak I observe him
      D                                      Em
    This is a people different from all nations!

        Em                 D
A. How beautiful are your tents |
                    Em      | (x2)
    how beautiful O Israel.      |

   G          D     G  Bm        Em
C. Who shall count your multitudes,
     D       Em     D       Em

A. Jacob O Jacob, Jacob O Jacob?

    G        D              G   Bm            Em
C. Let my death be like the death of your Just One,
     D                     Em
    Let my life be where He is

     D                     Em
A. Let my life be where He is
            Em                 D
    How beautiful are your tents ...

    Em                 D
C. But what are you doing?
                      Em
    You are blessing them!
     D                                         Em
    Come to another place, maybe from there God will curse them.
     G                D
    Listen, son of Zipor,
        G   Bm      Em
    give ear King Balak!
     D
    God is not a man
                      Em
    who says and then repents:
       D                   Em
    A star is rising from Jacob,
     D                         Em
    I hear acclamations for a King;
    D            Em
    God is his father:
       D                Em
    He crouches like a lion,
       D                Em
    He wakes up like a lioness,
       D               Em
    no one will make Him rise.

        Em                 D
A. How beautiful are your tents ...
