Am                                          Dm9
C. It was still night when Abraham
                                                   Am
prepared to sacrifice his son;
                                                               Dm9
the two looked in each other's eyes
                            E
when Isaac said:

   Am                Dm9                             Am

Am                                   Dm9
BIND ME, BIND ME FAST, 
                                               Am
MY FATHER, LEST I RESIST!

                                                        Dm9
C. Bind me, bind me fast, my father,
                                      Am
lest out of fear I resist
                                                     Dm9
and your sacrifice be not valid 
                                           E
and both of us are rejected!

C. Come and see faith on earth
                                                 Dm9
come and see faith on earth:

a father who sacrifices his only son
                                                                                E
and his dearest son offering him his throat.
