A. THE VOICE OF THE PROPHETS
                                      Am
ANNOUNCE THE LORD,

C. Behold a new light
arises in the morning;
a voice resounds:
the king of glory is coming.

A. IN HIS FIRST ADVENT
CHRIST CAME TO SAVE US,
TO HEAL THE WOUNDS
OF THE BODY AND THE SPIRIT.

C. In the end of time
he will return as a judge;
he will give the promised kingdom
to his faithful servants.

A. NOW, ON OUR PATH
HIS LIGHT SHINES:
JESUS, SUN OF GRACE,
CALLS US TO NEW LIFE.

C. You, O Christ, we seek
you, we want to know,
to praise you eternally
in the eternal kingdom.

A. TO YOU BE PRAISE, O LORD,
BORN OF THE VIRGIN MARY,
TO THE FATHER AND THE HOLY SPIRIT
FOREVER AND EVER.
G Am
AMEN.
