IF TODAY YOU LISTEN TO HIS VOICE Psalm 94 (95)

 E                          F#m
A.  If today you listen to his voice
B7           E
do not harden your hearts.
 C#m                         F#m
C.  Come, let us praise Yahweh joyfully
 B7                     E
acclaiming the rock that saves us.
C#m                 G#
Let us come to his presence with thanksgiving,
 C#m  E
acclaiming Him with psalms and songs.

 E
A.  If today ...

 C#m                F#m
C.  For Yahweh is a great God,
  B7                    E
a greater King than all other gods.
 C#m
From depths of earth to mountain top,
  G#
everything comes under his rule,
 C#m E
the sea belongs to Him, so does the land

 E
A.  If today ...

C#m                     G#
C.  Come, let us bow down before Him

and kneel
C#m
in front of Yahweh our maker.
 F#m      B7        E
For He is our God and we are his people
   C#m            G#
the flock that He guides
C#m   E
the people that He pastures.

 E
A.  If today ...

 C#m       G#
C.  If only, if only,

you would listen to me today
  C#m
and not harden your hearts,
  F#m
as at Meribah
B7                    E
as on that day of Massah in the desert,
 C#m
when your fathers challenged me
 G#
tested me
 C#m
although they had seen my deeds.
   F#m                   B7       E
For forty years that generation repelled me
 C#m                                     G#
until I said: they are a people with a crooked heart,

they don't know my ways,

so I swore in my anger,
 C#m E
they shall not enter my rest.


 E
A.  If today ...
