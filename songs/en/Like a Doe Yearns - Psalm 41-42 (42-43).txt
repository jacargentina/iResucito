C. Like a doe yearns for running streams,
                                                         F#m
so my soul yearns for you, O God.
                                                                      B7
My soul thirsts for God, the living God;
                                                                                E
When shall I come and see the face of God?

Tears are my bread day and night,

while my enemies say to me all day long,
                                 F#m
"Where is your God? Where is your God?

Where is your God?"
                   B7
This I remember 

and my soul melts in my heart

when I walked among the first ones
                                                       E
in the midst of a people rejoicing.

Why are you cast down my soul?
                                       C#m
Why do you sigh within me?

                      F#m                          B7
A. HOPE IN GOD, HOPE IN GOD

AND YOU WILL PRAISE HIM AGAIN.

C. Because He   is the salvation of my face.

C. How many times I said to my rock:

'Why have you forsaken me?'
                                                                               F#m
Why do I walk so sad oppressed by my enemies?
                                    B7
Crushed are my bones by listening all day long:

"Where is your God?
                                E
Where is your God?"

Lord, send your light and your truth;
                                                          F#m
Let the, lead me to your holy temple.
     B7
Then I will be able to sing to you a song of joy,
                                                                  E
a song of happiness with my guitar.
G#
Why are you cast down my soul.
