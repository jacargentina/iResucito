C. His body, enflamed with love,
                                             Am
living bread upon the cross,
                                       G
his blood on the altar,

chalice of the new covenant.

C. In this Paschal vesper sheltered
from the angel of destruction,
we have been delivered
from Pharaoh's harsh dominion.

C. Innocent, slaughtered lamb,
Christ is our Passover,
He, who offered his own body,
is the true unleavened bread.

C. O true and worthy bread
you unlock the gate of hell,
rescue people in fetters,
award fullness of life.

C. Christ, victorious from the abyss,
resurrecting from the tomb,
He subdues with chains the tyrant
restituting Paradise.oonor 

C. Let the paschal joy, O Jesus
be forever in our souls:
to new life reborn in baptism,
to your victory unite us.

C. Praise and honor be to Christ
who is triumphant over death
with the Father and the Spirit
now and forever.

A. Amen
