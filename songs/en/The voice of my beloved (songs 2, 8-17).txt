THE VOICE OF MY BELOVED (Songs 2, 8-17)

    C
C.  The voice of my beloved:
     Am              F
    behold here he comes
                    E
    leaping on the mountains
     F               F
    skipping on the hills.
    C
    My beloved is like a gazelle
     Am           F
    like a young deer,
                            E
    my beloved is like a gazelle.
    C
    Behold he stops
    Am          F
    behind our wall

    looks in at the window,
                        E
    peers through the lattice.
    C
    Now my beloved speaks and says to me:


    C(*)      E
A.  Arise my beloved!      |
     F                     |
    Arise my love,         | (x2)
                E          |
    Arise and come.        |


     Dm                            E
C.  Look, winter time has already passed
        Dm                              E
    the rains are over, they have gone away.
         F
    The flowers have appeared on the earth.
                                   E
    the time for singing has come again,
            Dm(**)                          E
    and the voice of the turtle-dove has returned,
     F
    the fig-tree has blossomed with first fruits
                                      E
    and the grape vine gives off its scent.(*)


    C(*)      E
A.  Arise my beloved!...
          E                        Dm
    O my dove in the cleft of the rock,
     Dm                            E
    in the hiding places of the cliffs,
     F
    let me hear your voice, let me hear your voice.
    C
    Send the foxes away, the small foxes,
    F               E
    who spoil the vineyard
    G        F              E
    for our vineyard is in blossom,
    G        F              E
    for our vineyard is in blossom.


    Dm                E       Dm        E
C.  My beloved is for me, and I am for him
      Dm                E
    before the breeze blows
              Dm                      E
    and the shadows of death stretch forth.


      Am       G      Am
A.  Return, Return, Return
