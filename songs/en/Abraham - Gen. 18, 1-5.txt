C. It was a very hot day

when Abraham

was sitting by the entrance of his tent.

It was a very hot day

when Abraham

was sitting by the Oak of Mamre.

He looked up, and there he saw

three men standing near him.

They stood in front of him.

As soon as he saw them

he bowed to the ground and said:

O my Lord don't pass by I beg You without stopping!

A. WITHOUT STOPPING DON'T PASS BY I BEG YOU

WITHOUT STOPPING

WITHOUT STOPPING!

C. I'll bring you a little water,

you'll wash your feet

and lie down under the tree.

I'll bring you a little bread,

you'll refresh yourselves

before going further.

Not by chance have You passed today near me.

A. O MY LORD DON'T PASS BY I BEG YOU

WITHOUT STOPPING

WITHOUT STOPPING!

DON'T PASS BY I BEG YOU

WITHOUT STOPPING

WITHOUT STOPPING!
