COME FROM LEBANON. (Song. 4, 8SS)

 Em             D
C.  Come from Lebanon, my bride,
C         D       Em
come from Lebanon, come!
 Em                D
You will have for a crown the mountains,
  C         D        Em
the highest crests of Hermon.
 Em                 D
You have ravished, ravished my heart,
 C   D          Em
o my sister, my bride.
 Em          D
Come from Lebanon my bride,
 C        D        Em
come from Lebanon, come.
 G                           A
A.  I have searched for the love of my heart,
  Am                    Em
I searched but I didn't find it
G                    A
I have found the love of my heart
   C           D                Em
I've embraced him and I'll not let him go.



C.  I belong to my beloved  (Chords as for the first verse)

and his whole desire is for me;

come let us go out in the fields

let us lodge in the villages.

Let us go out at dawn to the vineyards

Let us pick the grapes.

I belong to my beloved

and his whole desire is for me.

A.  I have searched ...


C.  Get up quickly, get up my dove

come away my dove

winter time has already passed

the voice of the turtle dove is heard.

The flowers appear again on the earth

the rain is over and gone

get up quickly, get up my dove

come away, my dove.

A.  I have searched ...


C.  Set me as a seal upon your heart

as a seal upon your arm.

for love is strong as death

love no flood can drown.

To give for it all the wealth of the house

would be to despise it

As a seal upon your heart,

as a seal upon your arm.

A.  I have searched ...
