    perfume of myrrh

    resting on my breast.

    Bm                Em
C. My beloved is for me
                        F#
    as a lily among the thistles

                       F#
    a cluster of henna flowers
      G                F#
    among the vines of Engedi.

     G                       F#

    Your eyes are doves,
    Em             F#
    your eyes are doves.

A. More than this our bed is all green.

    Bm                                       Em
C. As an apple tree among the trees of the orchards,
               F#
    so is my beloved,
         G                F#
    my beloved among the youth.
    Bm                            Em
    In his longed-for shade I am seated,
                       F#
    and sweet is his fruit,
         G                F#
    how sweet it is to my taste.
    G                                    F#
    He has taken me into the chamber of wine
             Em                F#
    and his banner upon me is love:
             G                       F#
    he has taken me into the banquet hall,
             Em                F#
    and his banner upon me is love;
    Em                     F#
    his left arm under my head
             Em            F#
    and his right arm embraces me.
        Bm                         A
    I implore you, daughters of Jerusalem  |
            G                              |
    do not rouse,                          | (ASS.RPT.)
                 F#                        |
    nor awaken my love.                    |
