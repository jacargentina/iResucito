C.  Listen to me remotest islands,

    all the nations,

    thus speaks the Lord, the Holy One of Israel:
         D
    'To him whose life is despised,
     F#m              G
    whom the nations loathe,
                                    F#
    to the slave of all the oppressors'.

A.  The kings shall see you,     |
                                 |
    they will stand up,          |
         F#m                     |
    the princes of the earth,    |
                    G            | (x2)
    they will bow down,          |
                                 |
    I've chosen you,             |
                F#               |
    I've chosen you.             |


     D
C.  On the day of salvation I shall listen to you,
             F#                    G
    on the favourable day I shall help you,

    for I have appointed you
                           F#
    as a covenant to the nations.

C.  You will say to the prisoners: 'Come out!
       F#m                    G
    To those who are blind: 'Look'

    You will guide the people
                      F#
    to the waters of life.

C.  But Zion says: 'The Lord has abandoned me,
           Em              F#
    the Lord has forgotten me.'
     G
    Can a woman
                            F#
    forget her baby at the breast?
         G                             F#
    Or fail to cherish the son of her womb?


    D          F#m                 G
A.  Even if a mother forgets her baby
                              F#
    yet, I will never forget you.
     G
    Look at me,                  |
                                 |
    I have branded you           | (x2)
                         F#      |
    on the palms of my hands.    |
