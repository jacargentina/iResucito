I HOPED, I HOPED IN THE LORD. Psalm 39 (40)

      Am                       Em
A.  I hoped, I hoped in the Lord
        Am                    Em
    and He has stooped down to me
         F                E7
    He heard my cry for help
         F
    He has pulled me out
                   E
    of the pit of death.


        Am                                 Em
C.  He has pulled me out of the mire of the marsh
        Am                    Em
    my feet He has set on a rock
          F               E7
    He has steadied my steps
         F                       E
    on a way, on a way of salvation.


      Am
A.  I hoped, I hoped ...


C.  He has put a new song in my mouth,
    a song of praise to our God.
    Many will come and see,
    they will trust in the Lord.


      Am
A.  I hoped, I hoped ...


C.  Happy the man who trusts in the Lord,
    who does not side with the proud,
    nor join those who follow false gods;
    happy the man who trusts in the Lord.


      Am
A.  I hoped, I hoped ...


C.  How many wonders have you done, O my Lord?
    How many plans have you make for us?
    Too many to be counted:
    no-one can be compared with you.


      Am
A.  I hoped, I hoped ...

C.  Sacrifice and offering you do not want;
    for this you open my ear.
    You did not want sacrifice for sin,
    then I said: "Here I am,
    I'm coming to do your will"

      Am
A.  I hoped, I hoped ...

C.  In the scroll of the book it is written of me:
    that I should do, O Lord, your will;
    my God this is what I want:
    your Word, your Word within me.
