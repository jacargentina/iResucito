A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C. Your right hand, O Lord,
glorious in power,
your right hand, O Lord,
shattered the enemy,
shattered the enemy.

A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C. The enemy said:
'I shall pursue and overtake,
I shall draw my sword,
my hand will get possesion
my hand will despoil them.'

A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C. You blew with your breath
the sea covered them.
They sank like lead
in deep waters,
in the waters of death.

A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C. Who is like you, among the gods
who is like you, O Lord,
magnificent in holiness,
terrible in deeds,
worker of wonders?

A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C. You led this people
that you have redeemed,
in your strength you guided them,
in your strength and love,
to your holy dwelling.

A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...

C. You brought them in and planted them
on the mountain of your promise,
where O Lord you reign,
you reign for all eternity
you reign for ever and ever.

A. He has thrown... My strength... He has thrown...
