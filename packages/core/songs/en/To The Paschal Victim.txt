                                                                    Dm
today let us raise the sacrifice of praise.

the Innocent has reconciled us sinners to the Father.
Am                 A7
Death and life faced each other 
                               Dm
in a wondrous duel.
      F                                          E
The Author of life was dead,
         Dm                F                  E 
but now he is alive and triumphs.

Empty, the tomb of the Lord
   Dm                                                 E
glory of the Lord and Christ alive,

the angels, the shroud and the sudarium.
Dm                                            E
For Christ, my hope, is risen
F                                                   E
and He precedes us into Galilee.
