      Am                       Em
A. I hoped, I hoped in the Lord
        Am                    Em
and He has stooped down to me
         F                E7
He heard my cry for help
         F
He has pulled me out
                   E
of the pit of death.

        Am                                 Em
C. He has pulled me out of the mire of the marsh
        Am                    Em
my feet He has set on a rock
          F               E7
He has steadied my steps
         F                       E
on a way, on a way of salvation.

      Am
A. I hoped, I hoped ...

C. He has put a new song in my mouth,
a song of praise to our God.
Many will come and see,
they will trust in the Lord.

      Am
A. I hoped, I hoped ...

C. Happy the man who trusts in the Lord,
who does not side with the proud,
nor join those who follow false gods;
happy the man who trusts in the Lord.

      Am
A. I hoped, I hoped ...

C. How many wonders have you done, O my Lord?
How many plans have you make for us?
Too many to be counted:
no-one can be compared with you.

      Am
A. I hoped, I hoped ...

C. Sacrifice and offering you do not want;
for this you open my ear.
You did not want sacrifice for sin,
then I said: "Here I am,
I'm coming to do your will"

      Am
A. I hoped, I hoped ...

C. In the scroll of the book it is written of me:
that I should do, O Lord, your will;
my God this is what I want:
your Word, your Word within me.
