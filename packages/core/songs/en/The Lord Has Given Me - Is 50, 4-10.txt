                                                          C
So that I may bring to the wearied
                         Bm
a word of relief.
                                         C                          Bm
Morning after morning you open my ear
                                C                Bm
so that I can listen as a disciple.

against insult and spittle.
Bm                                    C
Because I already knew
                                                     Bm
that you would come to my help

for this I’ve set my face hard as a flint
               C
I was sure
                                                       Bm
that you would come to my help.

who will fight against me?

  D                            F#m                             G

who will dare to condemn me?

Bm                                                C
C. All of you who fear the Lord,
                                                     Bm
listen to the voice of his servant
                                                     C
if you find yourself in darkness
