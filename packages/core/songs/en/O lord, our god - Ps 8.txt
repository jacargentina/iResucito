         Em                  G
C&amp;A. O Lord our God how great is your name
           B7
Throughout the earth, is your name;
          Am                          B7
above the heavens rises your love!

        Am                             B7
C. From the mouth of babes and infants
           Am                     B7
You affirm your glory O Lord,
          C                             B7
to reduce to silence enemies and rebels.

C&amp;A. O Lord ...

         Am                                         B7
C. If I look at the heavens, the work of your hands,
        Am                                          B7
the moon and the stars that you have set in place,
         C                           B7
what is man that you care for him?
         C                                  B7
The son of man that you keep him in mind?
       G       B7                                         G
Yet, yet you have made him little less than the angels
                                              B7
with glory and honour you have crowned him.
         C                                 B7
everything you have put under his feet.

         Em
C&amp;A. O Lord ...
