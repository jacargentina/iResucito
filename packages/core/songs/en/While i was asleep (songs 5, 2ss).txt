C. While I was asleep,
E
but my heart was awake,
      Am
the voice of my beloved I heard:
    Dm              E
'Open to me, my sister,
    Dm              E
open to me, my dove,

for my head is wet with dew,
            Am
my locks with the drops of the night.'
   C
He puts his hand
     E
through the latch of the door,
La-
my bowels stirred within me.
   Dm       E
I arose running.

and my hand dripped with myrrh,

the purest myrrh from my fingers
Am
on the bolt of the door.

    Am                           G
A. I implore you daughters of Jerusalem,   |
F                     |
if you find my beloved                  | (x2)
E                 |
tell him I'm dying of love.             |

   C
C. I opened to my beloved
    E
He was not there
Am
He had already gone.
    Dm                     E
My soul fainted at his flight;

I sought him, but I did not find him

I called him, I called him
Am
but he did not answer me.

The watchmen met me,
    G
going the rounds of the city,
     F
they undressed me,
               E
they beat me, the watchmen of the walls.

    Am
A. I implore you ...

   Am                    G
C. Ay! if you were my brother
F
I could kiss you
     E
without anyone being scandalised.

Note: Cantor sings "Ay, if you ..." while ASS. sings choral part
