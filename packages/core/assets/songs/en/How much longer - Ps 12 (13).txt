C. How much longer
                              E
will you forget me, O my Lord?
              E7                                 Am
How much longer will you hide your face from me?

A. I will sing to Yahweh,
             E                    Am
I will sing to Him who is my Saviour.

C. Look at me,
                            E
answer me Yahweh, O my love;

give light to my eyes
                            Am
lest I fall asleep in death.

            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh ...

C. Lest my foes say:
                            E
I have prevailed over him,

lest my oppressors rejoice
             Am
because I've stumbled.

            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh ...

     Am
C. But I,
                      E
I rely upon your love

and my heart shall rejoice
                Am
in your salvation.

            E       Am
A. I will sing to Yahweh ...
