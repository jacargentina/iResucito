A. Eli, Eli, lamma sabactani?

My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?

B7
C. How far I feel you from saving me,

I call on you by day and you do not answer,
                            Em
I call by night and there is no rest for me.

 Em          Am       Em
A. Eli, Eli, lamma sabactani? ...

B7
C. Yet you are the Holy One,

you dwell in the praises of your people.

In you my fathers have hoped,

and you have freed them;

they cried to you and they were saved,
                            Em
they hoped in you and did not remain confused.
      Am
But me? Why don't you help me?
       Em
Perhaps I am not a man?
 B7
Look, I am a worm; disgraced among men!

Rejection of my people!

All those who see me laugh at me,

twist their lips, shake their heads and they say:

'Let him turn to God, let God,

rescue him if it is true that
  Em
He loves him so much'.
               Am
Yes, you love me, yes you cherish me!
                    Am
You drew me out of my mother's womb.
B7
At my birth you picked me up,

from my mother's womb you have been my God.
                               Em
When I was being born she entrusted me to you.

 Em          Am       Em
A. Eli, Eli, lamma sabactani? ...

B7
C. Many bullocks surround me,

bulls of Bashan besiege me.

Against me they open their mouth,

like a lion raging and roaring,
 Em
like rabid dogs.
               Am
I am dirty water which is thrown away.
        Em
All my bones are wracked.
Si7
My heart is like wax,

melting away within my bosom.

As clay, dry as potshard is my palate,

my tongue is stuck to my throat,
                      Em
to ashes of death you have reduced me.

 Em          Am       Em
A. Eli, Eli, lamma sabactani? ...

B7
C. A pack of dogs surrounds me,

a gang of evil doers beseige me;

they have pierced my hands and feet,

I can count all my bones.

They stare at me, they observe me:

they divide their garments among them,
                 Em
and for my tunic they cast lots.
                    Am
But you Lord do not stay far away,
               Em
my strength, run, run to my help.
       B7
Save me from the sword, from the

claws of the dogs save my life,

save me, save me from the mouth of the lion

and from the horns of the wild bulls.
            Em
Save my life, save my life.

 Em          Am       Em
A. Eli, Eli, lamma sabactani? ...

C. I will announce your Name to my brothers,
                             B7
I will praise you in the midst of the assembly:
 Em
praise the Lord you who fear him,

sing to the Lord, descendant of Jacob.
                                        Em
Let the house of Israel fear him, all the race of Israel.
            Am
Because he was not disgusted with this poor man,
                Em               B7
he did not despise this wretched man, but at his cry

for help he answered him; he did
                        Em
not hide his face from him and help him
  Am
You are the object of my praise in the great assembly,
                                        Em
I will perform my vows in the presence of the Faithful.
            B7
Now I know that the poor will eat and be satisfied,

that everyone who looks for you will praise you,
                                      Em
heart of the wretched of the poor will live eternally.
 Am                                      Em
All the ends of the earth will return to the Lord,

all the family of nations shall bow down before him.
  B7
Because the kingdom, the kingdom belongs to the Lord,

He rules over all nations.

Before him whoever sleeps under the earth will bow down.
                                      Em
Only before him will bow all who go down to the dust.
Am                          Em
As I will live, I will live for him
                       B7
there my descendants will serve him.
                                        Em
Men will proclaim the Lord to generations still to come.
                Am                               Em
They will announce this pact and the nations that will be born,
                          B7
the nations that will be born, will say:
               Em
'behold the work of the Lord'.
