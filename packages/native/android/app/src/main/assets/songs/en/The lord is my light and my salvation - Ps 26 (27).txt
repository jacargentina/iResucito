    F    G      Am
whom need I fear?
   D             Am
The Lord is the fortress of my life:
F            G       Am
of whom should I be afraid?

Wait for the Lord, take courage
    Am
wait for the Lord, take courage
    E
wait for the Lord, take courage
    Am
wait for the Lord.

C. One thing I ask of the Lord,
one thing I only seek:
to live in the house of Yahweh
all the days of my life.

A. I am sure I shall see ...

C. For He hides me under His shelter
in times of trouble.
He hides me deep in his tent
sets me safe on a rock.

A. I am sure I shall see ...
