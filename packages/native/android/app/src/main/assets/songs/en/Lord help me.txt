never to doubt you

G7                 C
The gift of your grace
Am           F        E
has left my heart in blossom
 Em             E
with a thousand longings of love            (2)
 G            F
I can do no more
  E
than suffer
     F                E
and spend my life in sighs.
 C                                    G
And in this flame of your love, this dark flame,
                                         C
in this veil that enwraps my soul and stifles it,
 F                   E
I feel my heart dislocated
 F                E
opening, pouring out,
 F                                E
like water flooding through your garden.

 Am       G         Am
C &amp; A.O Lord, help me, O Lord!                   (2)
E
never to doubt you
 Am      G           Am
O Lord, help me, O Lord
 F                   E
never to doubt your love
