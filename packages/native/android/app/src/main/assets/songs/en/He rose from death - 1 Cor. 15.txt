A. He rose from death, he rose from death,
                                       F         E
he rose from death, alleluia!
                              Am        G          F
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia,
                                        E
he rose from death!
      Am                                             Am
C. Death                                  C. Thanks
                 G                                                 G
Where is death?                              be given to the Father
                   F                                                      F
Where is my death,                           who brings us to his kingdom
                   E                                                         E
Where is its victory?                        where we live through his love.

A. He rose...                             A. He rose...

C. Rejoice,                               C. If with Him we die,
                      G                                        G
oh brothers, rejoice                         with Him we live:
                            F
for if today we love each other,             with Him we sing:
                                  E                      E
it is because he rose from death.            Alleluia!
          

A. He rose...                             A. He rose...
