He laughs at them who sits in the Heavens,

from on high the Lord derides them

to them He speaks with wrath,
                          Em
He scares them in his anger.

He said to me, 'You are my Son

today I have begotten you.

Ask me, I will give you as possesion the peoples,
                                B7
as domains the ends of the earth,

you shall break them with rod of iron,

as clay vessels you will crush them.'

blessed is he who takes refuge in Him.
