with sapphires and with emeralds,
              G
all your walls with precious stones,
       Am
your towers with pure gold.
       G
Your squares are of rubies,
          Am
your streets of gold of Ofir.
          G
at your gates they will exult
          Am
in your houses they will sing

the inhabitants of the whole world
                         Am
will come to the house which bears your Name.

Am                                 G
The generations shall proclaim their joy
     Am
the nations shall sing:
                  G
and there the Name of your Elected One
   Am
shall endure forever.

C. Cursed be those who treat you badly
                  Am
cursed be those who will destroy you.
             G
those who break down your walls
            Am
and raze your towers to the ground.

 G                          Am
But blessed be, blessed be forever
 G                            Am
all those who built you, all those who rebuilt you
           G
happy are those who love you,
            Am
those who rejoice in your peace.
                     G
For at your gates there will be exultation,
                 Am
in your houses there will be singing.
